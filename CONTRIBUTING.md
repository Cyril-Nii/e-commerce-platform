## Style Guides

### 1. Git Commit Guidelines
- **Use meaningful commit messages**: Each commit message should clearly describe what changes were made.

Example:
```
Fix: Add validation for email format in registration form
Feature: Implement product filtering by category and price range
```

### 2. Coding Standards
- **PHP**: Follow the PSR-12 coding standard.
- **JavaScript**: Adhere to the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- **CSS**: Follow [BEM](http://getbem.com/) naming conventions when writing styles.
- **Laravel**: Follow Laravel's best practices for route naming, controller structure, and Eloquent ORM.
